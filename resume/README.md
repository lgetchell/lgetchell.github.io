# boilerPlate
This is my first experience coding anything. Going into this project I was very nervous that I would get lost and be unsucessful. Throughout creating this resume I learned many different ways to create and problem solve when the code wasn't working the way I wanted it to. I began with the basic layout and established a grid. From there I personalised everything from type to color and graphics. My SVG was hand drawn and traced into illustrator. The color animation process was a bit of a struggle, but with patience I found the fills of the SVG were interfereing with the color animation and was able to remove the fills from the code. Overall I enjoyed this project and can now confidently code in html and css.
